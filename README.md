1. how to use fetch data from an API
2. Routing in react using react-router-dom
3. hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef, useReducer
4. conditional styling to conditional style components depending on states
5. props drilling
6. Higher order array methods like map, filter, forEach etc 
7. many other fundamental concepts of javascript,
